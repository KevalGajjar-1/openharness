/**
 * Cloud agents (`cloud`), an experiment: harnesses that run on their maker's servers (Fo, Devin Cloud, Cursor
 * Cloud) and have no pane (cloud/service.ts, docs/design/2026-10-11-cloud-agents.md). The core lists them,
 * puts their questions in front of the person, and hands a New Harness for one, a message, an answer and a
 * Stop to this service through its port (core/agents/cloud.ts).
 * - In the core's process (`HARNESSD_SERVICES=none`) it starts here, on `core.cloud`; in its own process,
 *   services/cloudProcess.ts starts the same service on `core.cloud` asked over its link.
