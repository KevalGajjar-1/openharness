/**
 * Cloud agents in their own process (`harness __service cloud`), an experiment: the same service as in the
 * core's process (services/cloud.ts), answering two askers:
 * - the apps' requests, `cloud_transcript` and `cloud_agents`;
 * - the core, through its port (core/cloudLink.ts): `create`, `deliver`, `answer` and `stop`, named as the
 *   port's members so that a test's fault names the same member whichever process it runs in.
 *
 * What it tells the core (its harnesses, their questions) is asked of the core over its link
 * (services/processCoreApi.ts `cloud`), and told again whole each time it connects: a core that restarted
 * knows none of it.
