 * Otherwise it opens here, in the browser the person had (`BROWSER` before Harness set it), else the system's.
 *
 * Checked by Claude Code 2.1: it runs `$BROWSER <url>` and, should that fail, prints the address to open by hand,
 * so a daemon that cannot be asked costs nothing a pane without this did not already have.
