/**
 * A core's stop, bounded. Under harnessd the master gives its core `stopGraceMs` (2.5 s) to leave and kills
 * it after (harnessd/supervisor.ts). A core with no master had no such bound: Harness OS's
 * harness-daemon.service runs the core alone (HARNESS_NO_MASTER=1), and one step of the stop that never
 * resolved held it until systemd's own 90 s ran out, three seconds after boot, with the OS's update waiting
 * on all of it (2026-10-13). A core alone keeps the same time on itself, and says which step it gave up on.
 * By then the registry is already written: the stop flushes it first.
