# Durable native hook delivery

Status: implementation design, not a completed boundary. The former HTTP behavior
is recorded in golden-only commit `cb60ad66b`. Three private HTTP/registry regressions
in `d771b8836` fail on the former implementation: an owned pending delivery is lost
on restart, a completed delivery is notified again, and a changed payload under the
same delivery ID is accepted after restart. Receipt
`20261011T072723.699358Z-96575` records those assertion failures and the unchanged
passing Linux/macOS golden.

## Ownership before acknowledgement

Core must durably retain the immutable native body, delivery ID, native time,
original routing hints and proved engine process incarnation before acknowledging
owned pending work. A write that cannot be confirmed receives an unowned retry
response and a visible hold. Neither a service nor readiness waits for this work.

Use private, bounded, immutable intake/claim/result records under the daemon data
root. Each process-incarnation order namespace is keyed by kernel boot identity and
native engine birth identity. Agent ID is a separately checked ownership field,
not part of that key: two registry views of the same process must share one order
authority. A delivery ID is never reused within that process namespace. An
unavailable kernel boot identity holds new ownership instead of guessing from
wall-clock time. An immutable witness outside the record directory names its
identity and durable frontier: a missing or replaced history is unavailable
evidence, never an empty history that permits replay. The existing bounded native publication mechanism supplies
asynchronous file and directory sync, route/owner checks and actual-I/O capacity
retention. Existing corrupt, unsafe or contradictory records hold the delivery;
they are not absence. No record or user data is deleted to admit another event.

Healthy completed and held replies retain the former protocol. Distinct native
IDs remain distinct prompts, and one ID with another payload remains a conflict.
Legacy headerless callbacks can be durably owned under a generated ID, but cannot
prove that a later callback is their retry; the client protocol migration remains
necessary rather than pretending the server can infer that identity.

## Binding and crash recovery

An undispatched intake can be recovered after fresh proof that the exact original
engine process still owns the named route. Recovery must not depend on the original
short-lived hook parent PID. A replacement engine, reused PID, changed route,
unavailable process table or unavailable transcript cannot grant it authority.

Before binding and notifications, publish one exclusive effect claim. Only the
exclusive publisher, still in its original live attempt, may dispatch; confirming
an existing claim or its directory sync never grants dispatch ownership. Complete
results name that exact claim and are durable before the completed acknowledgement.
A receipt which already completed suppresses duplicate binding and notification.
An interrupted claim without a conclusive result is held visibly; it must never be
blindly dispatched again. Read-only reconciliation may establish facts already
committed, but cannot invent evidence that a callback or a turn-closing effect did
not occur. Completed prompt-time facts must be restored before they can contradict
a delayed Stop; optional notifications are not replay authority.

Every process has a recovery barrier. Before admitting a fresh conflicting hook,
applying a Stop, or publishing recovered interpretation, restore its complete
order frontier, maximum accepted prompt time for each conversation, unresolved effect claims and linked
Stop obligations. An incomplete scan holds that process with a visible reason.
It does not delay readiness or unrelated processes. A per-delivery claim alone
cannot serialize different delivery IDs from two cores: publication must share
per-process durable order authority: one immutable effect-slot chain per canonical
process key. Each exclusive slot names its validated predecessor result digest and
intake/frontier selection. Slot N+1 cannot dispatch until N has a durably confirmed
terminal result; an uncertain predecessor holds this process. Fresh frontier checks
alone cannot substitute for this shared chain. After each asynchronous durability boundary,
reprove current ownership and order, then check both again under the registry
commit boundary. An older claimant may not publish after a newer acceptance.

Recovery scans and active attempts need separate bounded capacities and fair
cursors. One stalled disk operation retains its actual I/O slot, while a bounded
reply keeps unrelated control responsive. Scans start after readiness, yield between
bounded batches, and cannot discard an old receipt to make room for a new delivery.
Shutdown revokes future effects before waiting for any outstanding operation.
The starting resource budget is 64 pending deliveries per process, 65,536 retained
deliveries and 256 process namespaces, with 16 MiB of retained active payload and
256 MiB of immutable disk history. Count metadata and linked obligations too.
Count concurrent reservations before publication, then reserve capacity before
acknowledgement and hold visibly when full; never prune
completion records to reclaim authority. Recovery inspects at most 64 directory
entries or 20 ms per slice, rotates processes fairly, and allows four recovery
attempts and eight actual disk publications globally. An expired reply retains
its I/O reservation until the underlying operation settles. These are resource
bounds, not measured performance targets.

Linked Cursor/Command Code Stop reserves a durable completion obligation with
its first registration intake. Registration completion and Stop completion are
separate states; recovery installs unresolved Stop obligations before attach can
publish interpretation. Calling the current void `onTurnStop` callback does not
complete that obligation: it schedules asynchronous drain/grace work. Keep the
obligation until core records an authoritative terminal outcome under fresh turn
ownership, or conservatively hold it. Optional notification dispatch can be marked
as dispatched; asynchronous session control cannot use that marker as completion. After restart the former in-memory Cancel witness is
gone: completion must remain held unless durable correlation and Cancel/forget
revocation prove which turn it can affect. Rebuilding an in-memory witness after
restart does not grant new permission.

The native client persists its immutable UUID, original fired-at time, exact body
and engine incarnation before the first send. Owned pending and retryable 202 are
different protocol states; HTTP success alone is not acknowledgement. Retained or
possibly sent work must not fall through to offline registry mutation. Recovery
after the original caller exits must reprove the saved engine incarnation and
route, rather than reuse the short-lived caller PID. Generated plugins migrate to
the same identity/time contract; already-loaded legacy plugins retain an honest
hold explanation. Client outbox recovery and server intake recovery are separately
bounded, and neither may invent ownership for the other.

## Required evidence

Keep the former delivery, admission and installation goldens unchanged for moves.
Add crash-boundary tests before/after intake sync, effect claim, binding publication,
result sync and reply, plus same-ID contention, immutable conflicts, original-process
revalidation, pressure/fairness and corrupted storage. Include separate-process
contention on different IDs and different agent IDs for one process, a paused
predecessor claim, receipt/directory disappearance, delayed Stop arriving
before recovery finishes, linked Stop then Cancel then core crash, and a crash
during asynchronous Stop handling.
Deliberately broken wiring must fail assertions. Private daemon acceptance kills
the core while a real native hook is held, confirms readiness and unrelated control,
then recovers exactly once without using an owner's daemon, homes or tmux server.
The final client-protocol change needs its own explicit compatibility evidence;
installer source snapshots must not be silently re-recorded to hide behavior changes.
